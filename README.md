# Registration-Parsing
Data sent from the Office of the Registrar is in a legacy format that is not easy to share with instructors. This project is meant to parse through this formatted .txt file and convert it into a .csv file with course numbers in the first column and authorization codes in all other columnts

This is a python 3 script, so it should be called using python3 as the executable in the following format:
python3 auth_code_parsing.py [filename.txt]
